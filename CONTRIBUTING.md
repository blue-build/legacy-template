Generally speaking we try to follow the [Lazy Concensus](http://lazyconcens.us/) model of development to keep the builds healthy and ourselves happy. 
   - If you're looking for concensus to make a decision post an issue for feedback and remember to account for timezones and weekends/holidays/work time. 
   - We want people to be opinionated in their builds so we're more of a loose confederation of repos than a top-down org.
   - Try not to merge your own stuff, ask for a review. At some point when we have enough reviewers we'll be turning on branch protection. 

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report should describe the issue in detail. Generally speaking:

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Remember that these are unofficial builds, it's usually prudent to investigate an issue before reporting it here or in Fedora!
- Collect information about the bug:
  - `rpm-ostree status -v` usually helps
- Image and Version 
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

### How to test incoming changes

One of the nice things about the image model is that we can generate an entire OS image for every change we want to commit, so this makes testing way easier than in the past. You can rebase to it, see if it works, and then move back. This also means we can increase the amount of testers! 

We strive towards a model where proposed changes are more thoroughly reviewed and tested by the community. So here's how to do it. If you see a pull request that is opened up on an image you're following you can leave a review on how it's working for you. At the bottom of every PR you'll see something like this: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1264109/221305388-3860fc07-212c-4eb9-80d9-5d7a35a77f46.png)

Click on "Add your review", and then you'll see this: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1264109/221307636-5e312e48-821f-4206-848f-7fbc2c91cd78.png)

Don't worry, you can't mess anything up, all the merging and stuff will be done by the maintainer, what this does is lets us gather information in a more formal manner than just shoving everything in a forum thread. The more people are reviewing and testing images, the better off we'll be, especially for images that are new like Sericea.

At some point we'll have a bot that will leave you instructions on how to rebase to the image and all that stuff, but in the meantime we'll leave instructions manually. 

Here's an example: https://github.com/ublue-os/nvidia/pull/49

## Building Locally

The minimum tools required are `git` and a working machine with `podman` enabled and configured.

Building locally is much faster than building in GitHub and is a good way to move fast before pushing to a remote.

### Prerequisites

#### On the developer host

- Add an entry for the container registry to your `/etc/hosts` file

   ```ini
   # Container registry
   127.0.0.1 registry.dev.local
   ```  

- Start the container registry

   ```bash
   podman run -d --name registry.dev.local -p 5000:5000 docker.io/library/registry:latest
   ```

#### On the VM where you want to test the image

- Find out the IP address for the default gateway

  ```bash
  ip route | grep "default via" | cut -d ' ' -f 3`
  ``` 

  _Example Output:_
  
  ```bash
  $ ip route | grep "default via" | cut -d ' ' -f 3
  10.0.2.2
  ```

- The VM needs to find the container registry on the host system. Add the IP address of the default gateway to the `/etc/hosts` file

   ```ini
   # Container registry
   10.0.2.2 registry.dev.local
   ```

- Since the container registry is running in "insecure" mode we have to create the file `/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/ublue-dev.conf`
   with the following configuration.

   ```toml
   [[registry]]
   location = "registry.dev.local:5000"
   insecure = true
   ```

### Build the image

- Make sure you can build the existing image

```bash
podman build . -t registry.dev.local:5000/ublue-main:dev-latest
```

- Upload image to the container registry

```bash
podman push --tls-verify=false registry.dev.local:5000/ublue-main:dev-latest
```

### Rebase to DEV image

To rebase your test VM to the DEV image you can run

```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:registry.dev.local:5000/ublue-main:dev-latest
```

### Make your changes

This usually involved editing the `Containerfile`.
Most techniques for building containers apply here, if you're new to containers, using the term "Dockerfile" in your searches usually shows more results when you're searching for information.

Check out CoreOS's [layering examples](https://github.com/coreos/layering-examples) for more information on customizing.

## Reporting problems to Fedora

We endevaour to be a good partner for Fedora.

This project is consuming new features in Fedora and ostree, it is not uncommon to find an issue.
Issues should be reported upstream, and in some cases we can help test and find fixes. 
Some of the issues you find may involve other dependencies in other projects, in those cases the Fedora team will tell you where to report the issue. 

Upstream bug tracker: [https://github.com/fedora-silverblue/issue-tracker/issues](https://github.com/fedora-silverblue/issue-tracker/issues)

## Styleguides
### Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and enforce them with a bot to keep the changelogs tidy:

```
chore: add Oyster build script
docs: explain hat wobble
feat: add beta sequence
fix: remove broken confirmation message
refactor: share logic between 4d3d3d3 and flarhgunnstow
style: convert tabs to spaces
test: ensure Tayne retains clothing
```
