        We have detected the limited, Fedora-provided Flatpak remote on your system, whose applications are usually missing important codecs and other features. This step will therefore remove all basic Fedora Flatpaks from your system! We will instead switch all core Flatpak applications over to the vastly superior, unfiltered Flathub. If you don't want to do this, simply exit this installer.
