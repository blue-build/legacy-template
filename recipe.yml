# These scripts will be executed during the container build.
# Place scripts in "scripts/" and put the corresponding filename here.
# Any files that aren't listed here won't be executed automatically, which
# means that you can place "helper" or "library" scripts in the folder too.
scripts:
#  - example.sh

# A list of urls of ".repo" files that should be added to your system.
# This is the proper way to add custom COPR repos to your image.
# Tip: Use `%FEDORA_VERSION%` instead of static Fedora version numbers, so that
# your repos automatically use the Fedora version defined in `fedora-version`,
# which greatly simplifies future maintenance of your custom recipe.
extrarepos:
  # Example (which also demonstrates version number expansion):
  # - https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/starship/repo/fedora-%FEDORA_VERSION%/atim-starship-fedora-%FEDORA_VERSION%.repo

# These RPMs will be removed from the system image. This step happens during
# image build, before installing custom RPMs (from the "rpm-install" category).
rpm-remove:
  # Remove the native firefox (from Fedora) in favor of the Flatpak.
  - firefox
  - firefox-langpacks

# These RPMs will be installed from your enabled repositories (Fedora's own repos,
# any "extrarepos" you've added, etc). The installation is automatically performed
# via rpm-ostree during the image build, and will be pre-installed in the final image.
rpm-install:
  # Needed for yafti (the first boot installer). Remove if you're not using yafti.
  - python3-pip
  # GNOME's GTK4 Theme, Libadwaita. It already comes with silverblue, but not other spins.
  - libadwaita
  # Add your own below:
  # - tilix

# These Flatpaks will be suggested for install on user login, via the yafti
# "first boot" GUI. By default, the menu also shows up again anytime the image's
# yafti configuration differs from the user's last encounter, so feel free
# to expand the selection over time. Your users will then see the yafti menu
# again after OS update, and will be given a chance to install new additions.
# Everything below will be merged into the "etc/yafti.yml" configuration on build,
# in a category named "Custom". If you prefer, you can instead remove everything
# below and purely use "etc/yafti.yml" to have more control over settings.
# This is just an example selection.
